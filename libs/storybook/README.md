## Introduction

Welcome to our Storybook Library, the visual playground for our UI components. This Storybook setup serves as a dynamic environment for developing and showcasing the components used across various applications within our NX monorepo. It's an essential tool for visualizing component behavior and ensuring design consistency.

## Getting Started

### Installation

Since Storybook is integrated into our monorepo, no separate installation is required. Ensure that your monorepo dependencies are up to date.

##Â Development Workflow

### Running Storybook

To launch the Storybook interface and explore our component library, execute:

```bash
npm run start:sb
```

This command will start the Storybook server, making the interface available at `http://localhost:4400` in your default web browser.

###Â Building

To create a production build of your Storybook library, which compiles all the stories and components into optimized, static files, run the following command:

```bash
npm run build:sb
```
